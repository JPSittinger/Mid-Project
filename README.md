# RENTAL PRICE PREDICTION THROUGH LOCATION

## This project was done as mid-project in the IRONHACK Data Analysis Bootcamp

This project did the following:
- Webscraped all listed rental properties for Barcelona from habitaclia.com to perform analysis of rental price distribution throughout the districts
- Combined this data with geodata from Open Data BCN to calculate correlations of rental price with noise pollution and air pollution and visually compare the distributions (Tableau, see presentation)
- Build a machine learning model trying to predict the rental price through the location, air pollution and noise pollution



The webscraping code was obtained and changed accordingly for my project from COrtsJosep from his project TFG-2021:
